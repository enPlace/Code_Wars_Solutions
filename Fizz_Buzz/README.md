#Fizz Buzz
Description:

Return an array containing the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the parametered value. N will never be less than 1 (in C#, N might be less than 1).

Replace certain values however if any of the following conditions are met:

    If the value is a multiple of 3: use the value "Fizz" instead
    If the value is a multiple of 5: use the value "Buzz" instead
    If the value is a multiple of 3 & 5: use the value "FizzBuzz" instead

Method calling example:

fizzbuzz(3) -->  [1, 2, "Fizz"]


#Pseudo Code
return an array with n numbers for range n, n+1
check if divisible by 3 and five first, replace with "FizzBuzz"
check if divisible by five, replace with "Buzz"
check if divisible by 3, replace with "FizzBuzz"
